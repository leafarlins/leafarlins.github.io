Hello World! This is a first message of a initial post in this blog.

This website was made by Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple static site generator. You can write your post in a markdown language, and it churns through layouts do create a static website.

In [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) you may see a quickstart and details about how it works. There is also a list of templates available there.

Static web sites can be hosted by github pages, and for free. Give it a try!

I'm still exploring the jekyll world. I'm not from the frontend world neither website programming languages, but you know... we try to handle it as we can. The [WebJeda blog](https://blog.webjeda.com/) has great articles and tutorials about jekyll and other frontend/web stuffs  :)

See ya!
