I would like to chat about some places I've been traveling too.

In this first post, I don't know why, I've remembered about Amsterdam... !

In 2011, in my first trip through Europe, I've been in 3 very different places in a row: London, Paris and Amsterdam. I loved them all! But something in this city have touched me.

Amsterdam is known for its cycling ways. There are approximately 750.000 people living there, and 800.000 bicycles! Wow! And, of course, the city is bike-friendly.

When I travel, as far as it is possible, I like to feel like the people that live in the city. So, I take the bus, subway or... bicycle! We can rent a bike and know the city by this means. I did that for 24 hours, and it was great to have a different view of the city and to go from a place to another. If you can do it, maybe this is the best city to rent a bike.

I heard that a common problem in Amsterdam is that the canals of the city are full of bicycles, because drunk fools go out of pubs and, why not, steal some bikes to throw them to the water. Just a story from my guide. lol

But, yes, the city is well known for its canals as well. There are impressive more than 1.500 bridges!

About places to visit, I will talk about the ones I've been. I know that are a lot of others, but these are some of them, and the ones I was able to visit for the 3 days I've been there.

I'm a big fan of Heineken, so... Heineken experience give us a teste of the beer, since its first phases until the bar and the draft beer we know well. We can understand how the beer is made and a little bit of its history.

The Van Gogh Museum is great. For those who like art galleries, it is a must see.

There is an ICE BAR in the city... well, it is just the same feeling of being drinking inside a fridge, and not knowing why you're there, because out there is already cold enough...

There is plenty of bars and good restaurants, the center, some museus, and the red light district, of course. There is still a place for prostitution and people looking behind it, but it is interesting to see how it is so organized. Each thing in its place. And it is much safer and calm than any other downtown with "involuntary" prostitution.

The main place to visit, I think, is the Anne Frank House. The very place where she lived with her family, memories, closets and bedrooms where to hide... that is a great memory of the times of war and that girl is incredible. She became what she wanted to be, a famous writer. Sadly, this way. Deserves an entire post.
